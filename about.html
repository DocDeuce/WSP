				<h1>Doc Deuce is an artist, activist, and entrepreneur.</h1>
				<p>I've been adept with visual aesthetics for as long as I can remember and writing songs since age nine. I started taking art class at the high school while I was still in elementary. Life has brought me a long way and I have been fortunate to evolve as an artist and, more importantly, as a person. People know me these days as the eloquent Hip Hop lyricist who competes in rap battles wearing a necktie and performs with a live band including a cellist. What's not widely known is that I'm also currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in web design and development.  So, while I grow my influence as a musical artist I'm further developing my skills as a visual artist. Within three years, the name Doc Deuce will be associated with art for the ears, eyes, heart, and mind.</p>
				<p>In 2010, I started a movement dubbed "Run This Town" that aimed to unite the Hip Hop artists, businesses, and non-profits within the Austin, TX metropolitan area. Via this movement, the Hip Hop community in Austin became more tightly knit and got involved in local issues. Activism, to me, isn't strictly political but can take the form of any action geared towards having an impact on something bigger that oneself. Whether it's participating in school board meetings, supporting local businesses, or picking up trash, activism is something that can be redefined as the things we all do everyday that impact the world we share. I will start another activist movement to inspire people to get involved in shaping our world more actively.</p>
				<p>Doc Deuce is not only my pseudonym but it's also my business. Some have been surprised while writing a check to me when I told them to make it out to Doc Deuce. Years of experience in both business-to-consumer and business-to-business sales taught me a lot about interaction and led me to become an informal but avid student of marketing. My business and marketing plans were forged by an intelligent and learned mind. As cocky as that sounds, I am humble enough to know that I still have much to learn, that plans may change, and that I can't do this alone. The business-minded way in which I conduct myself has helped me to build meaningful relationships with other business owners and influencers throughout Austin. I will continue working to build and strengthen these relationships to better position myself among the people who make things happen.<p/>
